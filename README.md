A brief tutorial will be available upon the completion of the program.

In order to get a feel of the program, copying the files found in the "sample_records" folder and pasting them into the "data" folder is recommended. This will mean that the program will have existing sample records that you can feel free to experiment with. 

When you want to genuinely begin using the program, do not forget to delete these sample files and start fresh.
